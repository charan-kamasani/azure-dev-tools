# Open SRE Agent Canvas

Use this skill for diagnosing failing Azure apps and operating Azure SRE Agent resources (`Microsoft.App/agents`) — the same surface exposed by the Azure MCP Server's `sreagent_*` tools (agents, connectors, threads, investigations, incidents, scheduled tasks, memories, skills, and workflows).

When this skill is selected:

1. Immediately call `open_canvas` with:
   - `canvasId`: `azure-sre-agent`
   - `instanceId`: `azure-sre-agent`
2. Reuse that instance ID so a later matching prompt focuses the existing canvas instead of opening duplicate panels.
3. Do this even if the user says "app is failing", asks to investigate a named app, provides an SRE Agent external share link, mentions a resource name or ICM/S360 ticket id, or says "something's broken". The canvas is the front door for those flows.
4. Do not replace the canvas with a generic explanation, generic Azure diagnostics session, or infrastructure implementation. Open SRE Agent Canvas first for failing-app diagnosis, ticket correlation, incident/investigation management, and SRE Agent operations.
5. Tell the user the canvas is open and guide them to **By subscription** to select a subscription and SRE Agent, then either diagnose an app resource or paste an ICM/S360 ticket reference. For an external share link or resource ID, guide them to the **External URL or Resource ID** tab and **Connect to agent**; do not claim a link connects automatically. Stars beside picker rows and the current connection save/remove Favorites without connecting; selecting a Favorite row reconnects.
6. Leave infrastructure changes, deployment work, and non-SRE-Agent diagnostics to the general Azure skills unless the user explicitly asks for that work after the canvas handoff.

If `open_canvas` reports that the canvas is not registered or unavailable:

1. Inspect the host's plugin and extension status. The complete plugin declares its provider for native discovery; do not bootstrap a second source-folder provider.
2. If the plugin is enabled, call `extensions_reload`.
3. Retry `open_canvas` once with the same canvas and instance IDs.

Preserve existing installations and user state. Use a host-declared `extensionId`
when multiple providers are available; never guess a provider.

If the retry still fails, give the user these installation paths in order, then stop:

1. If **Azure SRE Agent** is listed in the public **Azure Dev Tools** marketplace,
   use **Customize → Plugins → marketplace gear** to add
   `microsoft/azure-dev-tools` (marketplace ID `azure-dev-tools`) and install
   **Azure SRE Agent**. The full plugin includes this routing skill and the canvas.
2. If it is not listed, follow **Optional: pin the full plugin to an exact
   release** in the [public Azure SRE Agent installation instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/tree/main/canvases/azure-sre-agent#optional-pin-the-full-plugin-to-an-exact-release).
   Use this path only when those instructions and a matching versioned tag are
   published; do not substitute the movable `latest` tag for a versioned release.
3. If the full plugin is unavailable, the [canvas-only installation URL](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/tree/azure-sre-agent-latest/canvases/azure-sre-agent/com.github.copilot/extensions/azure-sre-agent)
   is a last fallback, when published. It does **not** install this routing
   skill; open **Azure SRE Agent** from installed canvases if the prompt does
   not route. If none of these public paths is available, report that and stop.

After installation, tell them to reload extensions, fully quit and reopen
GitHub Copilot, start a fresh chat or child session, and retry the same prompt.
Do not silently fall back to an unrelated generic diagnostics workflow.

## Prerequisites

The canvas drives Azure SRE Agent (`Microsoft.App/agents`) through the caller's own `az login` session, matching the setup for the Azure MCP Server's `sreagent_*` tools:

- Azure CLI installed and signed in (`az login`).
- For read-only/shared use, control-plane read access such as `Reader` or `Contributor`, plus `SRE Standard User`, on the target SRE Agent resource (or a parent scope).
- Additional SRE Agent administration or Azure resource roles are required only for corresponding write operations.
- An existing Azure SRE Agent resource in the subscription. The canvas cannot create the agent resource itself in v1 - point users to Azure portal / `az` if none exists yet.

If Azure Resource Graph cannot enumerate a resource-scoped share, use the
canvas's **Open a shared agent** field with the exact Azure resource ID or
`sre.azure.com` URL instead of treating an empty picker as proof of no access.
