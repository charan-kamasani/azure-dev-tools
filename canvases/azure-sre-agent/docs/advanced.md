# Azure SRE Agent: alternative installation and operational notes

Diagnose failing Azure applications with an existing Azure SRE Agent.

## Install the full plugin

When the **Azure Dev Tools** marketplace lists **Azure SRE Agent** in GitHub
Copilot, go to **Customize → Plugins → marketplace gear**, add
`microsoft/azure-dev-tools` (marketplace ID `azure-dev-tools`), and install
**Azure SRE Agent**. The full plugin includes both the canvas and its
`azure-sre-agent-canvas` routing skill.

Fully quit and reopen GitHub Copilot, start a fresh chat, and try this exact
prompt:

```text
Open SRE Agent Canvas
```

Confirm the canvas opens and the routing skill appears in your host; a
marketplace listing alone does not prove App registration or prompt routing.
The marketplace follows the current public catalog, not an exact version pin.
If the plugin is not listed, use a published versioned tag for the full plugin
below, or the canvas-only fallback at the end.

## Optional: pin the full plugin to an exact release

For a reproducible 0.2.7 full-plugin install after its production tag is
published, use the versioned and source-qualified tag. In a terminal with Git
and Copilot CLI, run:

```bash
SRE_TAG=$(git ls-remote --refs --tags https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools.git 'refs/tags/azure-sre-agent-v0-2-7-*' | awk '{sub(/^refs\/tags\//, "", $2); print $2}')
if [ "$(printf '%s\n' "$SRE_TAG" | grep -c '^azure-sre-agent-v0-2-7-')" -eq 1 ]; then
  git clone --depth 1 --branch "$SRE_TAG" https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools.git azure-sre-agent-plugin &&
    copilot plugin install ./azure-sre-agent-plugin/canvases/azure-sre-agent
else
  echo "Expected exactly one published SRE 0.2.7 tag" >&2
fi
```

If the versioned tag has not been published or more than one matches, stop
and check the published release tags. The `azure-sre-agent-latest` tag can
move and does not pin a version. This checkout includes the canvas and routing
skill without relying on the current marketplace listing. Fully quit and
reopen GitHub Copilot, start a fresh chat, and retry the prompt above. If
your host does not expose CLI-installed plugins, check its plugin status.
The CLI currently warns that local-path plugin installation may be
deprecated in a future version.

## Canvas-only fallback

If the full plugin is unavailable and the production `latest` tag is published,
go to **Customize → Canvases → Install from gist/URL**, paste the
[Azure SRE Agent canvas-only URL](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/tree/azure-sre-agent-latest/canvases/azure-sre-agent/com.github.copilot/extensions/azure-sre-agent),
and install. This URL uses the movable `latest` tag and installs the canvas
only, **not** the `azure-sre-agent-canvas` routing skill. Fully quit and reopen
GitHub Copilot. If the prompt above does not route, open **Azure SRE Agent**
from your installed canvases. Do not install a second provider to work around
a missing canvas.

## Prerequisites

- A Copilot host that supports the installation path you choose and Node 22
  or later.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  installed and signed in with `az login`.
- Access to an Azure subscription containing an existing Azure SRE Agent, with
  permission to view and use it. This plugin does not create the agent resource.

If the canvas reports `fetch failed`, a network restriction may be preventing
access to Azure or the agent endpoint. Check your VPN and network connection,
then retry. This error alone does not establish that your Azure login or RBAC
needs changing.

## Use and safety

You can also ask:

```text
Investigate this failure
Investigate issues in <yourappname>
Investigate why Function App orders-api returns 503 after deployment
```

Choose your subscription and SRE Agent in **Azure Configuration**, then open
**Apps** to diagnose a failing resource. Select a thread in **Threads** to
inspect its evidence and status in **Active thread**. Choose
**Focus this thread** before operational follow-ups in chat, then **Unfocus**
when finished.

For an external or shared SRE Agent, paste its `sre.azure.com` share link or
Azure resource ID into **Open an agent by URL or resource ID** and choose
**Connect to agent**. Use **Save connected agent** to add it to **Favorites**;
select the saved agent later to reconnect without repeating the lookup.

The canvas uses your Azure CLI identity. Its read and write actions are
registered; mutating operations require an explicit action or host
confirmation. One-time execution authorization is separate from durable role
assignment. Delegated private-connector mutations require
`ALLOW_PRIVATE_CONNECTORS=true` and must not be used for production or
multi-user private connector isolation without verified per-invocation
ownership.

If the canvas is missing, fully quit and reopen GitHub Copilot, start a fresh
chat, and retry the exact prompt. Check plugin and extension status rather
than installing a second provider; reinstall via the same path you chose
(canvas extension or full plugin). If agents do not appear, check
`az account show`, your selected subscription, and your agent permissions.
